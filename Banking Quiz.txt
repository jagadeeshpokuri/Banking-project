1) Find mean of the variable age. Round off to 2 decimal places.

Ans- 40.91


2) Total number of outliers present in the variable balance.Use ‘Q1-1.5*IQR’ to calculate lower limit and ‘Q3 + 1.5×IQR’ to calculate upper limit.
Calculate the count of values in variable balance which are beyond these limits.

Ans-3329


3) Find the variance of variable balance.

Ans-9273256


4) which function is used to remove multicollinearity among variables?

Note: Answers are not case sensitive.

Ans-vif


5) Model with 'lower AIC' value is a better model or the model with 'higher AIC' value?

Note: Write either 'lower AIC' or 'higher AIC', any further details will result in your answer being marked as wrong. 
Answers are not case sensitive . 

Ans-lower AIC


6) Should the variable ID be included in building the model?

Note : Just write 'Yes' or 'No' . If you write sentences , automated grading will consider it incorrect .Answers are not case sensitive

Ans- No


7) Does validation help in generalising the model?

Note : Just write 'Yes' or 'No' . If you write sentences , automated grading will consider it incorrect .Answers are not case sensitive . 

Ans- Yes


8) Whether the data given (train data) is a balanced or extremely imbalanced data( ratio of response class counts even more extreme than 5%:95%)? 

Note: you need to write either 'Balanced' or 'Imbalanced' . Any further details will result in your answer being marked as wrong. Answers are not case sensitive . 


Ans-Balanced


9) How is box plot upper whisker is calculated ? Choose out of these:

Select one:
a. Q3 + 1.5×IQR
b. Q3 + 3*IQR
c. mean + 2*sd

Ans- a. Q3 + 1.5×IQR


10) R2 or adjusted R2, which metric to be used to check goodness of the model?

Note: Answers are not case sensitive . 

Ans- adjusted R2
